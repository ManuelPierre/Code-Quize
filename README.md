# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

I built a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
It is a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
so that the user can gauge their progress compared to their peers.

While taking a code quiz, when you click the start button
then a timer starts and you are presented with a question
when you answer that question then then you are presented with another question. If you answer a question incorrectly then the time is subtracted from the clock when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the game is over, when the game is over, then I can save my initials and score.
